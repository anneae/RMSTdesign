Description: Calculates the asymptotic power of the test of the difference in 
    restricted mean survival time under user-specified trial design parameters, 
    or the sample size required for a specified power. It also provides 
    the probability restricted mean survival time will be estimable using the area
    under the Kaplan-Meier curve, and, if desired, plots of power versus design 
    parameters and empirical power based on simulations.
