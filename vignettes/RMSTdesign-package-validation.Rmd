This vignette validates the internal functions of the `RMSTdesign` package by using them on a toy dataset and comparing the result to by-hand calculations. Then, it confirms that the power returned by the `RMSTpow` function is close to the empirical power across a wide variety of scenarios. For Weibull scenarios, we also confirm that the power is close to the empirical power from the `SSRMST` package.
